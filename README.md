# NGINX-PROXY TEMPLATE FOR DOCKER-COMPOSE 

This project aims to allow multiple websites or applications to be hosted on the same VPS with a free SSL certificate issued by Let's Encrypt.
This project used [Nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) to route traffic to different container and [acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion) to automate creation and renewal of SSL certificate.
